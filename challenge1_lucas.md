# Solution

Here is what I did to find the plaintext.
First, I ran a frequency analysis at the website:
http://www.richkni.co.uk/php/crypta/freq.php
From that I found out the most common 3 letter sequence was "dro" and assumed that would be "the". Then from that we figured out it was a shift of 10 letters.
